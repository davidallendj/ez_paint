- [x] Set up environment and get program to compile.

- [x] Build a simple grid using the Grid class.

- [ ] Convert Grid class to Canvas??

- [x] Implement spatial hashing collision detection.

- [x] Optimize collision detection using a Quadtree or Octree.

- [ ] Add visualizations to show how the collision detetion iterates.

- [ ] Implement multithreading (thread pool) to separate UI from collision detection.

- [ ] Update to use C++20 features (including modules and co-routines).

- [x] Remove need for SpriteBatch and GridCell class by converting Grid class into custom SFML entity.

- [x] Integrate Dear ImGui interface for simple user interface. 

- [ ] Detect when mouse is clicked on Dear ImGui interface vs application.

- [ ] Implement generic Tree class to make Quadtree and Octree typedef aliases (instead of separate class with separate implementations).  

- [ ] Integrate a file dialog extension to Dear ImGui to open and save files.

- [ ] Load/save configuration to file where executable is built.

- [ ] Update the README.md file for the project.
